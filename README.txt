There are two atlases -- mean orientation and orientation variability 
of the cortex with respect to the B0 axis. 
The details of atlas creation are in [1]. The atlas is derived from 
110 subjects from the Open Access Human Connectione Project (S1200, 
accessed 07/2017), see Acknowledgment.

There are atlases for various cortical and sub-cortical depths, with 
the convention:
10 -- pial surface
in 0.1 increments of absolute cortical thickness:
09, 08, 07, 06, 05 (mid-depth), 04, 03, 02, 01
00 -- white surface
in 0.1 increments of absolute cortical thickness (until hitting 
opposite bank's surface) below the white surface:
sub01, sub02, sub03, ...sub10
